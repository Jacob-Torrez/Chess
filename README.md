# C++ CLI Chess Game

Welcome to my C++ Command-Line Interface (CLI) Chess project! This project showcases my growing expertise as a Computer Science student, integrating key concepts of game development, artificial intelligence, and algorithmic optimization. I challenged myself to build a functional chess engine from scratch, and while there is always room for improvement, I am proud of what I have accomplished.

## Overview

The main goal of this project was to implement a fully functional chess game within a CLI environment. The game includes several key features:

- **Player vs AI:** The AI utilizes the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to evaluate moves efficiently.
- **Player vs Player:** Two players can compete in a standard chess match.
- **Piece Movement and Move Validation:** The program enforces legal moves according to chess rules.
- **Draw and Checkmate Detection:** Includes basic detection for draws and checkmates.
- **Text-Based Chessboard:** A clear, visually structured board displays the game state.

This project has been an incredible opportunity to strengthen my skills in C++, algorithm design, and game development. Implementing the chess engine and AI deepened my understanding of decision trees, heuristic evaluation, and optimization strategies. The experience has reinforced the importance of structured code organization and efficient problem-solving.

## Future Improvements

While I am pleased with the current functionality, I have identified several enhancements that could elevate the project further:

1. **Bitboard and Zobrist Hashing:**
   - Transitioning to a bitboard representation would improve performance by enabling efficient bitwise operations.
   - Implementing Zobrist Hashing would optimize board state storage, making move tracking and state comparisons more efficient.

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - A GUI would enhance the user experience and make the game more accessible. While I initially focused on core mechanics, integrating a visual interface would be an exciting challenge in future iterations.

3. **Rule Completeness:**
   - Adding advanced chess rules such as threefold repetition and the fifty-move rule would ensure the game adheres to official regulations.
   - Improving endgame detection and refining draw conditions would enhance gameplay accuracy.

4. **Code Optimization and Testing:**
   - Refactoring the code for efficiency and readability would make future development smoother.
   - Implementing comprehensive unit tests would improve reliability and streamline debugging.

## Closing Remarks

This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a programmer. While there is always room for refinement, I am proud of the foundational work I have built. Developing a chess engine from scratch was both a technical challenge and a rewarding learning experience. It reinforced my understanding of algorithmic decision-making, game logic, and structured programming.

Although I am pausing active development for now, I see this as a stepping stone rather than a finished product. With more experience, I look forward to revisiting and enhancing the project with improved efficiency, new features, and a more polished design.

I am excited to continue pushing my skills forward and taking on even more complex programming challenges in the future!
